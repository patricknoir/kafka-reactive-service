A reactive system is a server which exposes services using message exchange pattern rather than synchronous IO communications (for example HTTP).
Using message exchange rather than synchronous communication helps to build more decoupled systems, which gives us several advatages like:

1. Isolation: if a reactive system fails it doesn't affect its client.
2. Location transparency: reactive systems they don't communicate directly but through messages sent to 
   an address (topic), that way is not necessary to know the location of the reactive system exposing the
   service as long we can send a message to the topic address.
3. Elasticity: reactive services can implement scaling strategy on the way they consume the messages from a
   topic allowing to add (scale out) and remove (scale down) more reactive systems depending on the current
   demand.

Reactive System
---------------

In order to build a reactive system you need 3 elements:

1. A source of ReactiveRequest messages
2. A router able to dispatch ReactiveRequest messages to the associated ReactiveService
3. A sink of ReactiveResponse messages which will send the response to the right destination

```

*Scala API:*

```scala

import org.patricknoir.kafka.reactive.server.dsl._

implicit val system: ActorSystem = ...
import system.dispatcher

val source: Source[KafkaRequestEnvelope, _] = ...

val route: ReactiveRoute = ...

val sink: Sink[Future[kafkaResponseEnvelope], _] = ...

val reactiveSys: ReactiveSystem = source ~> route ~> sink
```

Or alternatively the DSL exposes also:

```scala

val reactiveSys: ReactiveSystem = source via route to sink
```

Or more basic:

```scala

val reactiveSystem: ReactiveSystem = ReactiveSystem(source, route, sink)
```


Reactive Source
---------------

A reactive source is the inbound gateway from which request messages are processed by the reactive system.
As part of the Kafka-Reactive-System there is a KafkaReactiveSource object which provides a method create to build
a reactive source able to consume from a Kafka topic.

```

```scala

val source: Source[KafkaRequestEnvelope, _] = ReactiveKafkaSource.create(
  requestTopic = "simpleService", 
  bootstrapServers = Set("localhost:9092"), 
  clientId = "simpleServiceClient1"
)

```

Reactive Route
--------------

The reactive route is the component in charge to analise the KafkaRequestEnvelope message and dispatch the request to the relevant service.
In order to accomplish to its task the reactive route must know all the reactive services we want to expose.

A reactive route can be though as a mapping between the Reactive Service URI and its current implementation:

``` 
                                    
                                        /---->{Service: echo}
                                        |                    
             __________                 |                    
            |          |----------------'                    
            | Reactive |                                     
            |  Route   |------------------------>{Service: size}
            |          |                                        
            '----------'                                        
                    |                                           
                    \--------------->{Service: reverse}         
                                   
                                      
```

### Reactive Service

The reactive service represents the entry point of your business logic. A reactive service is nothing more than a function which has an input 
and can produce a result, because the input and output are delivered through messages the input type must be deserializable and the output serializable.

*Scala API:*

```scala

case class ReactiveService[-In: ReactiveDeserializer, +Out: ReactiveSerializer](id: String)(f: In => Future[Error Xor Out])

```

From the Scala API you can notice that the service has a unique ID, the execution of the ReactiveService is "intrinsicly" asynchronous and eventually returns a business error.  

### Reactive Route DSL

In order to make it easy to create a ReactiveRoute with all its services associated a specific dsl has been developed.

*Scala API:*

```scala

val route: ReactiveRoute = request.aSync[String, String]("echo") { in => 
    s"echoing: $in"
  } ~ request.aSync("size") { (in: String) =>
    in.length
  } ~ request.sync("reverse") { (in: String) =>
    in.reverse
  }

```

### Route DSL: The request object

The Reactive Route DSL is built around the *request* object which exposes the following functions:

```scala
object request {
    def apply[In: ReactiveDeserializer, Out: ReactiveSerializer](id: String)(f: In => Future[Error Xor Out]): ReactiveRoute =
      ReactiveRoute().add(ReactiveService[In, Out](id)(f))
    def sync[In: ReactiveDeserializer, Out: ReactiveSerializer](id: String)(f: In => (Error Xor Out)): ReactiveRoute =
      ReactiveRoute().add(ReactiveService[In, Out](id)(in => Future.successful(f(in))))
    def aSync[In: ReactiveDeserializer, Out: ReactiveSerializer](id: String)(f: In => (Error Xor Out))(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): ReactiveRoute =
      ReactiveRoute().add(ReactiveService[In, Out](id)(in => Future(f(in))))
  }
```

It allows to map ReactiveService against a specific service ID, lifting the service to a future in a synchronous or asynchronous way.
If the function in request is already returning a Future than you can simply use the apply function.

#### sync vs aSync

So the DSL offers you the option to lift a function to a reactive service by lifting it to a future:

```scala

//sync:
def sync[In: ReactiveDeserializer, Out: ReactiveSerializer](id: String)(f: In => (Error Xor Out)): ReactiveRoute =
      ReactiveRoute().add(ReactiveService[In, Out](id)(in => Future.successful(f(in))))
```

In this scenario we will be using the same thread the router is running on.

In the case of aSync:

```scala
def aSync[In: ReactiveDeserializer, Out: ReactiveSerializer](id: String)(f: In => (Error Xor Out))(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): ReactiveRoute =
      ReactiveRoute().add(ReactiveService[In, Out](id)(in => Future(f(in))))
```

the ReactiveService is using a Future on a new thread and an implicit execution context is necessary.

#### Route DSL: Future Flatten

Last but not least if your function is already returning a Future you can simply use the *request.apply*:

```scala
def apply[In: ReactiveDeserializer, Out: ReactiveSerializer](id: String)(f: In => Future[Error Xor Out]): ReactiveRoute =
      ReactiveRoute().add(ReactiveService[In, Out](id)(f))
```

#### Route DSL: Handle Xor

As you could have noticed the ReactiveService combine the effect of a Future with a Xor\[Error, A\].
If your function is not already returning a *Xor\[Error, A\]* then we will implicitly lift it:

```scala
implicit def unsafe[Out: ReactiveSerializer](out: => Out): (Error Xor Out) = Xor.fromTry(Try(out)).leftMap(thr => new Error(thr))
```

Reactive Sink
-------------

Once a ReactiveService has been executed by the ReactiveRoute a *Future\[Error Xor A\]* will be returned where if you remember the signature of the ReactiveService
the type *A* is a member of *ReactiveSerialzable*. What we need to do now is to send this Future to a Sink which can handle that type, once the Future completes we 
can then Serialize either the result *A* or the *Error* from the Xor, wrap it into a *KafkaResponseEnveplope* and send it back to the client who requested it.

Reactive Client
---------------

...


```scala

trait ReactiveClient {

  def request[In: ReactiveSerializer, Out: ReactiveDeserializer]
    (destination: String, payload: In)(implicit timeout: Timeout): Future[Error Xor Out]

}
```


*Kafka Implementation:*

```scala
class KafkaReactiveClient(settings: KafkaRClientSettings)(implicit system: ActorSystem) extends ReactiveClient
```


*Scala API:*

```scala

implicit system: ActorSystem = ...
import system.dispatcher
implicit val timeout = Timeout(3 seconds)
val client = new KafkaReactiveClient(KafkaRClientSettings.default)
val fResponse = client.request[String, String]("kafka:echoInbound/echo", "patrick")

result.onSuccess { 
    case Xor.Right(result: String) => println(result)
}

...

```

### Reactive Serializer/Deserializer


In order to serialise/deserialise message payloads two methods are available which make usage of the relative Typeclasses: ReactiveSerializer/ReactiveDeserializer:
...

```scala
package object common {

  object deserializer {
    def deserialize[Out: ReactiveDeserializer](in: String): Xor[Error, Out] = implicitly[ReactiveDeserializer[Out]].deserialize(in.getBytes)
  }

  object serializer {
    def serialize[In: ReactiveSerializer](in: In): String = new String(implicitly[ReactiveSerializer[In]].serialize(in))
  }

}
```

#### Default Serializers

```scala
trait ReactiveSerializer[Payload] {

  def serialize(payload: Payload): Array[Byte]

}

object ReactiveSerializer {
  implicit val stringSerializer = new ReactiveSerializer[String] {
    override def serialize(payload: String) = payload.getBytes
  }

  implicit def circeEncoderSerializer[In: Encoder] = new ReactiveSerializer[In] {
    override def serialize(payload: In) = payload.asJson.noSpaces.getBytes
  }

  implicit val byteArraySerializer = new ReactiveSerializer[Array[Byte]] {
    override def serialize(payload: Array[Byte]) = payload
  }
}
```

#### Default Deserializers

```scala
trait ReactiveDeserializer[Payload] {

  def deserialize(input: Array[Byte]): Xor[Error, Payload]

}

object ReactiveDeserializer {
  implicit val stringDeserializer = new ReactiveDeserializer[String] {
    override def deserialize(input: Array[Byte]) = Xor.Right(new String(input))
  }

  implicit def circeDecoderDeserializer[Out: Decoder] = new ReactiveDeserializer[Out] {
    override def deserialize(input: Array[Byte]) = decode[Out](new String(input)).leftMap(err => new Error(err)) //FIXME : use custom errors
  }

  implicit val byteArrayDeserializer = new ReactiveDeserializer[Array[Byte]] {
    override def deserialize(input: Array[Byte]) = Xor.Right(input)
  }
}
```
